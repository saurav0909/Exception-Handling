Checked Exceptions in Java
These are the exceptions that are checked at compile time. If some code within a method throws a checked exception, then the method must either handle 
the exception or it must specify the exception using the throws keyword. In checked exceptions, there are two types: fully checked and partially 
checked exceptions. A fully checked exception is a checked exception where all its child classes are also checked, like IOException, 
and InterruptedException. A partially checked exception is a checked exception where some of its child classes are unchecked, like an Exception.
